This is the Google Chrome extension for adding a product with our internal API. 

To install-

-clone this repo
-in Chrome go to the extensions page, turn on developer mode, and hit 'load unpackaged extensionâ€¦' and choose this folder.
-Go to an amazon page and hit the icon.

to do-

-make sure the form works, I have done nothing really with this so far (new version needs to be up)
-handle the form response, right now it opens up in the popup, but there is chrome API to open in a new tab
-make prettier

outsiders - this will only work if you have an admin cookie
